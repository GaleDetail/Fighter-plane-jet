# Fighter Plane Jet üõ©Ô∏èüí•

## Concept
In this game, players control a fighter plane navigating through obstacles. Players can upgrade their plane's abilities and have control over target selection. Without player intervention, the plane continues moving forward, automatically destroying targets and earning coins based on upgrades. Players can set weekly records, and leaderboard toppers receive rewards.

## Uniqueness
A linear idle game with player competition elements.

## Mechanics
- The player's plane automatically moves through continuous obstacles, selecting an existing safe path.
- Players can choose the direction of fire by targeting.
- The plane fires automatically along a straight path when the player doesn't intervene.
- Each obstacle has its own durability and value. More valuable obstacles are not centered, preventing automatic destruction.
- Destroying obstacles and covering distance earns players coins.
- Upon collision, the plane turns into a ghost form, continuing slow movement through objects without firing, earning coins for distance covered.

## Upgrades
- Players can spend coins on upgrades such as increased rate of fire, damage per shot, and plane durability.
- Plane durability determines the number of obstacles that can be rammed before turning into ghost form.

## Additional Mechanics
- Weekly leaderboard updates for various categories: Longest distance, blocks destroyed per unit distance, shortest time in ghost form, etc.
- Reward system for returning players, providing periodic balance replenishment to prevent zero balance situations and encourage continued play.
